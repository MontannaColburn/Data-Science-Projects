### Identifying Amazon Food Reviews 
Overview: In this report, I use NLP for feature generation and compare clustering methods to supervised learning models for classifying Amazon Food Review Scores. 
Skills: EDA, Data Cleaning, NLP, KMeans Clustering, Logistic Regression/Random Forest Modeling. 

### Predicting Forest Cover Types 
Overview: This project was created to bring insight into forest habitats, and help in forest regrowth and preservation. It will show us what supervised learning classification models are best suited for a multi-classification prediction of forest cover type. 

Skills: EDA, Visualizations, Ft. Engineering, Logisitc Regression/Random Forest/Extreme Boost Modeling. 

### Active Satellites Analysis 
Overview: Ever wonder what's out in space and what we're using it for? Through this analysis, I seek to identify the countries with the most amount of satellites in space, what their usage is for, and whether or not the number of satellite launches are increasing. 

Skills: EDA, Visualization, Statistical testing, Narrative analytics
