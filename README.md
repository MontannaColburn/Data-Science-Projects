### Forecasting Future Sales: A Time Series Analysis Utilizing Deep Neural Networks
Overview:
For this project I paired with Enterprise Training Solutions (ETS), and compared the classic Time Series ARIMA model to a LSTM deep neural network in an attempt to predict future sales for ETS. I will also compare the use of an Extreme Gradient Boost model on Time Series data, and digest it's inner workings using the SHAP library.

Skills:
EDA, Data Cleaning, Time Series, Arima Modeling, Feature Engineering, LSTM RNNs, XGBoost Modeling, Feature Importance

### Classifying Amazon Food Reviews 
Overview: In this report, I use NLP for feature generation and compare clustering methods to supervised learning models for classifying Amazon Food Review Scores. 

Skills: EDA, Data Cleaning, NLP, KMeans Clustering, Logistic Regression/Random Forest Modeling. 

### Predicting Forest Cover Types 
Overview: This project was created to bring insight into forest habitats, and help in forest regrowth and preservation. It will show us what supervised learning classification models are best suited for a multi-classification prediction of forest cover type. 

Skills: EDA, Visualizations, Ft. Engineering, Logisitc Regression/Random Forest/Extreme Boost Modeling. 

### Active Satellites Analysis 
Overview: Ever wonder who's satellites are out in space and what they're used for? Through this analysis, I seek to identify the countries with the most amount of satellites in space, what their usage is for, and whether or not the number of satellite launches are increasing. 

Skills: EDA, Visualization, Statistical testing, Narrative analytics
