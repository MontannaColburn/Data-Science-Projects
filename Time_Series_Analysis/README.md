## Forecasting Future Sales: A Time Series Analysis utilizing Deep Neural Networks
### Overview: 
In this report, I compare the classic Time Series ARIMA model to a LSTM deep neural network in an attempt to predict future sales for Enterprise Training Solutions.
I will also compare the use of an Extreme Gradient Boost model to Time Series data, and digest it's inner workings using the SHAP library.
